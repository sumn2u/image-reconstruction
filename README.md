## Image Reconstruction Comparisons and Algorithm

**Motivation :**
> That said, a research paper must include some original contributions,
introducing novel ideas and proving its validity and improved performance.
In fact, writing a research paper is the culmination of an intense dedication to research,
having analysed different hypothesis and assessed their appropriateness.

**Goals :**
- use different image compression techniques to get compressed images
- compare different image enhancement algorithms
- purposed own algorithm
- compare it to other alogorithms
